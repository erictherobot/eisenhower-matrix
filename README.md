# Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a task management tool that helps you organize and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance. It divides tasks into four boxes based on the tasks you'll do first, the tasks you'll schedule for later, the tasks you'll delegate, and the tasks you'll delete.

## Uses Local Storage

This app does not store personal data in a database. Instead it leverages Localstorage which is a web storage API that allows you to store data in the browser. This means that the data is stored locally, and will not be sent to a server. If you delete the browser cache, the data will be deleted as well.

## How to use

1. Add a task to the list by typing it in the input field and clicking the add button.
2. Click on the task to mark it as completed.
3. Click on the trash icon to delete the task.
4. Click on the edit icon to edit the task.

## Drag and Drop

You can reorder the tasks by dragging and dropping them into the desired position.
